Queueing network models have proved to be cost effectwe tools for analyzing modern
computer systems. This tutorial paper presents the basic results using the operational
approach, a framework which allows the analyst to test whether each assumption is met
in a given system. The early sections describe the nature of queueing network models and
their apphcations for calculating and predicting performance quantitms The basic
performance quantities--such as utilizations, mean queue lengths, and mean response
tunes--are defined, and operatmnal relationships among them are derwed Following this,
the concept of job flow balance is introduced and used to study asymptotic throughputs
and response tunes. The concepts of state transition balance, one-step behavior, and
homogeneity are then used to relate the proportions of time that each system state is
occupied to the parameters of job demand and to dewce charactenstms Efficmnt methods
for computing basic performance quantities are also described. Finally the concept of
decomposition is used to stmphfy analyses by replacing subsystems with equivalent
devices. All concepts are illustrated liberally with examples
Keywords and Phrases" balanced system, bottlenecks, decomposability, operational
